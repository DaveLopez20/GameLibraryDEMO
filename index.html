    Should games be delayed until they've finally finished the game or just get the game and wait for a while to get updates?

  <h3>Recommendations</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    For the people who are new to gaming do you want to play a zombie game that requires good teamwork and have a great time? Then play Left 4 Dead 2 it is one of the best zombie games of all time with great characters, maps, and weapons. What's even great is the fact that if you get the game in Steam you can access the workshop and get a bunch of mods and you would either get a good laugh or be awesome.

  <h3>Requirements on having a Great Weekend!</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    If you have nothing to do in the weekend then here is a list of things that might make your weekend feel relax yet great.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Get your friends either online or in person to play with friends.</li>
      <li>Get games that are co-op so you can have a great time with your friends and hopefully find games where there is no chance of your friends rage quit.</li>
      <li>If you are in person then you should get food so your friends get energy (small chance of feeling tired). If you are playing online then grabbed some snacks for yourself since there will be times when you would get hungry.</li>
    </ul>
