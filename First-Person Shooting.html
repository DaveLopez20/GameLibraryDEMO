    <p>
    For the new players, do you want to play a classic game with iconic multiplayer, an interesting campaign, and a great zombies mode. The game I'm talking about is Call of Duty Black Ops 2. Out of it series it's the most iconic since it has made many memories for people who played this game. It's multiplayer that has a lot of memorable maps including Nuketown 2025. The campaign was interesting since it was the first few games in the series that implemented choices that would make the game replayable. Plus, the zombies mode is a lot of fun with friends and seeing how long you guys survive.

      <li>In Team Fortress 2, there was a character that supposed to appear called The Civilian who was surprisingly appear in the First Team Fortress game.</li>
      <li>In Black Ops 2, the reason the map Tranzit was foggy was because the game couldn't handle the hardware of the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. Which surprised me since they were able to make the zombies map Origins with the Robots.  </li>
