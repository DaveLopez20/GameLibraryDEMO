			<div><h2>The Adventure genre has the creative worlds out of the genre. The genre combines Adventure with Action, which makes sense since both are exploring and fighting. Some games have a world that makes you explore it because of its uniqueness. It's like a book you read, and you want to experience the world, and when you see it on the game, you will be amazed at how it looks. Sometimes, it can be a movie where the stunts will be more creative and worry a little on budget.</h2></div>
