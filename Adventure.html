	    <h2>The Adventure genre has the creative worlds out of the genre. The genre combines Adventure with Action, which makes sense since both are exploring and fighting. Some games have a world that makes you explore it because of its uniqueness. It's like a book you read, and you want to experience the world, and when you see it on the game, you will be amazed at how it looks. Sometimes, it can be a movie where the stunts will be more creative and worry a little on budget.</h2></div>

  <h3>Random Fun Facts</h3>

    Here are somethings you might not know about.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In Fallout 4, when you enter your name in the beginning, Codsworth can say your name. What's even hilarious is that you can put in names like Ziggy, Nuke, or even Humongous, and Codsworth will say it out loud.</li>
      <li>In Far Cry 5, you can find an easter egg related to Stephen King's IT when you enter the haunted house. When you find a red balloon in the attic with a voicemail of a clown laughing like a maniac, which is a reference to Pennywise.</li>
      <li>In GTA 5, there is a reference to Red Dead Redemption in Franklin's Home in his room, there is a bookcase, and one of the books is called Red Dead. The author's name is J Marston, probably Jack since he mostly reads books in Red Dead Redemption 1.</li>
