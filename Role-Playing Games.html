    For people new to gaming, do you want to steal hearts and save the common man, then play Persona 5 Royale. You started out as a student who got framed for a crime he did not commit, and you stumbled upon a place called a Palace, which is located in a dimension called Mementos. You and your friends started a group called the Phantom Thieves, and you stole the hearts of the corrupted to see them change their hearts. The game has cool gameplay and a really good soundtrack.
